Code snippets, tools and libraries related DevOps. But what is [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)...

## Libraries

[Oh, shit, git!](http://ohshitgit.com/), helpful commands when you screwed with Git.

[OneFlow](http://endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow), a Git branching model and workflow. Simplier, yet powerful alternative to Gitflow.
