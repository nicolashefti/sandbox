# Git sandbox

My experimenting place.

The motto: minimal amount of code to create the first "sparks".

## Frontend

- [RxJS](rxjs)
- [Github page test](test), playing around with Github page configuration.
- [Media carousel](frontend/components/media-carousel.html), using Sly, Youtube API and a spoon of material design.
 
### CSS Tricks

- *[Not so sticky footer](frontend/css/sticky-footer-small-page.html)*, a footer that is sticky only if the content of the page is smaller than the current display.
- *[Sticky container with centered container](frontend/css/sticky-footer-vertical-center-container.html)*, variant of the previous one.

## Devops

- [Devops section](devops)

## Build locally

```
