I had code snippets all over different computers, on CodePen and various other *fiddle. I finally decided to collect and
 organize everything in one place. What you see is the result of this work (still in progress, I have to say). Have fun
 exploring my sandbox and all the toys it contains!


## Frontend

UX/UI experimentation, code snippets, tools and [more resources](frontend)

### Component

- [Media carousel](frontend/components/media-carousel.html), using Sly, Youtube API and a spoon of material design.
- [Affix navigation](frontend/components/affix-navigation.html), using Bootstrap 3
- [Scroll-spy navigation](frontend/components/scroll-spy-navigation.html), using Bootstrap 3
 
### CSS Tricks

- *[Not so sticky footer](frontend/css/sticky-footer-small-page.html)*, a footer that is sticky only if the content of the page is smaller than the current display.
- [Sticky container with centered container](frontend/css/sticky-footer-vertical-center-container.html), variant of the previous one.
- [Multiple borders elements](frontend/css/multiple-borders.html), add more than one border on an element using pseudo-classes.

### Libraries

- [RxJS](rxjs)
- [Github page test](test), playing around with Github page configuration.
