## Tested libraries

### Swipe, carousel

- [Sly](http://darsa.in/sly/)
- [Swipe](https://github.com/thebird/Swipe), Swipe is the most accurate touch slider. 
    - Pros: lightweight, no jQuery dep
    - Cons: missing some unit/e2e tests

### Responsive table

- [Tablesaw](https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw), a group of plugin for responsive table.
    - Pro: lot of configurations
    - Cons: 
        - limited to ```<table>``` markup. Cannot use with your home-made ```display: table```.
        - no catch/continuous-swipe movement effect
