Mustache Start
==============

In 2014, France sent to the Eurovision a group called "Twin Twin" singing "Moustache". France ended up last of the contest. This repo is not about this epic fail.

[mustache.js](http://github.com/janl/mustache.js) is an implementation of the [mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) template system in JavaScript.

**Usage**: a webpage retrieves JSON data from a REST API and renders it in HTML with the help of mustache.
